####
This repo contains code for my personal website which was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Theme of the site is a mix of Vanilla and Lodi. 
The site is deployed to my custom domain and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
This website will serve as my portfolio and a place for my future blog posts and projects.
